Note: tune parapeters lambda1, lambda2, lambda3, neighbor, and r to achieve the best results. (Generally, you can set neighbor = 7, and r = 3 in most cases.)

Influneced by the initilzation of k-means or the matlab versions, the clustering results may have little deviations to the reuslts reported in the paper.
